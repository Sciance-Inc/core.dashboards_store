    This script forecast the number of currently active employes retiring in the next 5 years.
    The forecast is done using the Kaplan-Meier survival curves estimated in the stg_retirement_survival_curve.sql script.

    I first group together active employes by age (called cohorts) then `age` the whole cohort for up to 5 years, I then compute the cohort survival rate by applying the Kaplan-Meier estimator to each cohort x projected-age combination.
    Finaly, retiring employees for each year is then computed by differencing (first-order) the previously obtained number of surviviors for each year with respect to each cohort.

    About the horizon 0 forecast : 
    * Since I'm differentiating the cumulated survival to get the instantaneous survavival, the horizon 0 will act as a kind of a normalization constant and will capture some of the noise from the survival curve partial mis-fitting.
    * The horizon 0 has, from a dashboarding viewpoint, no real meaning and is removed from the final table
