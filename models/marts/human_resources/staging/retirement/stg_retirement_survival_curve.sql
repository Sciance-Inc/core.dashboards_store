    This table estimate the survival curves through a Kaplan-Meier estimation.
    Survival is defined as the probability of not being retired at a given age.

    About the event:
    * The Event is the time of retirement.
    * Since some people retire in an other CSS, I only consider the retirement of thoose who retire in the CSS.

    About the censure :
    * The time-of-censure is computed, FOR NON-RETIRED EMPLOYEES ONLY as the age the employee had as the time of his last pay.
    * Every employee that is not retired (quitter, vacation, payed leaves) is considered censored at the time of his last pay.

    About the univers :
    * Some employees will work AFTER they have retired (what a frightening world we live in). 
    Since I can't know their status for sure, employees first employed after they have reached the honorable age of 60 years old (or about 6 time the average live span of a duck) are removed from the dataset and aren't not considered survivors.
