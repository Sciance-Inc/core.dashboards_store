    Create a dummy table with no rows. Actually selecting 0 rows is required as DBT does not support no-data materializations.
    The `adapter.get_relation` pattern can only be used with seeds and not tabLe.

    This table acts as an entry point for the custom population and has to be overrided from the cssXX.data.core_dashboards_store.
