	Parse the XML of the historical hcha_pai_dos_empl to get PIT data.

	A note on XML parsing
	As querying XML columns are not supported by linked servers, I have to relay on the openquery function, providing the table is accessible as from a linked server.
	If not, direct querying of the XML column is possible.
