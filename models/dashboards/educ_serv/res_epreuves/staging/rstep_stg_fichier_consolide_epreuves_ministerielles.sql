    The dashboards needs manually extracted data from the ministery to be complete.
    As the operation might be cumbersome, the store adopts a defensive approache and does not requiers it. The seed is implemented as an optional seed.
    To avoid requiering manual disabling from the client, the store will try to fetch the seed and just return an empty table if it does not exists.
