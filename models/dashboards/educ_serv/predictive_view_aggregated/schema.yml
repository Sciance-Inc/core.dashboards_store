      - name: quantile
        description: The approximate quantile of the shap value for the school, model, target, category and scope combination. Estimated using the prdctv_vw_stg_shap_quantiles table.

    description: >
      Staging model. 
      Used to store the quantiles of the SHAP values as computed for each model, target, category and scope. The computed, empirical quantiles can be looked up in this table to get an approximate quantile for a givent shap value.
