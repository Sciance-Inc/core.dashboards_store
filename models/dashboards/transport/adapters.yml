# Declare sources to be instanciated in your cssXX.data.store repo for the transport dashboard to work.
sources:
  - name: transport
    description: >
      Transport sources gather all the sources / adapters required for the transport dashboard to work.
      Thoose sources are arbitrary populated dimensions helping with the data drill down.
    tags:
      - transport
      - adapter
    schema: "{{ target.schema }}_dashboard_transport_staging"
    tables:
      - name: stg_sectors # Use the ALIAS to refer to this table as the look-up is done on the objects stored in the database, and not on the file name.

          Sectors are an arbitrary mapping of circuits to geopgraphical areas.
          How many sectors schould be set is up to each CSS and schould reflect the requiered level of detail for the dashboard.
          Dashboards's metric will be computed at a sector level.
          As an example, Haut-Cantons uses tree sectors populated as follow : 
          * circuits_id < 500 are mapped to Coaticook
          * circuit_id between ]500 and 600] are mapped to East Angus
          * Circuits <= 500 are mapped to Lag-Megantic.

          Of course you can use MORE (or less) than 3 sectors. It's really up to you. 
          The following constraint apply :
          * Each circuit_id must belong to EXACTLY ONE sector
        columns:
          - name: circuit_id
