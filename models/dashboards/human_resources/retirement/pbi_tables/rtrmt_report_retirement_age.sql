    Compute the number of retirees and the age they retired at per school year, job group, workplace, engagement status, and employment status.

    Because of the double-granularity difference (age and school_year) with the rtmrt_report_active_employees_age table, a surrogate key is generated to allow the user to filter on both dimensions at the same time
