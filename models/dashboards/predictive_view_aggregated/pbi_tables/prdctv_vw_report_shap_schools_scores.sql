    For each model, target, category, school and population compute the percentile the averaged school shap value belongs to.
    
    By using the quantile (over the (schoolboard level) distribution of students) we get a relative comparison of a school to the general population and hence a better understanding of the school's performance without expliciting ranking the schools between them.
