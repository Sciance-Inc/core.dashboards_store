### Fix

* fix: disembiguate duplicates resulting from multiple fetchs from the Jade database

Done with Fred and Mohamed :

* Remove duplicates introduced by fetching the Jade database multples times.
* Only the most recent upserted grade is now used., Previous results are removed. ([`b66b53e`](https://github.com/Sciance-Inc/core.dashboards_store/commit/b66b53ec6f377ee072240be60bc1dd46f4f6a098))

### Refactor

* refactor(hr mart): switching to historical activity table

This PR refactors the RH mart and introduces new tables than can be used to ease future downstream computations.

* This PR firsts adds a new **historical** `stg_activity_history` tables. This table is a consolidated version of `pai_hemp`
* The main job history of employees, which was previously unavailable, is built by parsing the XML payload of `hcha_pai_dos_empl`.
* A **historical**, table with point-in-time metadata is derived from precedings table. This `fact_activity_yearly` provide the point-in-time following attributes :
    * workplace
    * stat_eng
    * stat_empl
    * main_job (main ref empl)
    * This table can then be used a a spine to add point-in-time filters to every metrics computed at an employee / year level.
* A `fact_current_active_employees` table is derived from the `fact_activity_table`, listing all the currently enroled employees is introduced.

The retirement dashboard is rebuilt upon the new tables.

To reduce the need for double joining on both `pai_dos` and `pai_dos2`, a new `dim_employees` is created, providing usefull static information at the employees level. Future static metrics of interest could be added to this table.

As noted by Maryna, the meaning of the seeds is not constant over time. To allow for time-varying seed, the two existing seeds are refactored with the addition of two new columns : `valid_from` and `valid_until`.

Yearly versions of the seed tables are derived in `dim_employment_status_yearly` and `dim_engagement_status_yearly`. The two derived tables expand the seeds by year. Time varying mapping can then by handled by joining on both the code (ex stat_eng) and the year we want the valid code for.

Permanence will be rebuilt upon the new activity table. For now, the table is flagged as deprecated and a new `stg_seniority` is added as work-in-progress.

* `stg_seniority` will be completed in another PR, this one being big enough.
* Refactoring other RH dashboards schould be done in another PR

* A new seed, `int_sequence_0_to_1000` is introduced. This seed can be cause to generate integer sequences.

# What is left out of the pull request
* Due to the summer break, the human resources&#39; product owner (@&lt;melanie.ranger&gt; ) hasn&#39;t review the dashboard yet. The wording of the dashboard, as well as some cosmetics adjustments following Mélanie&#39;s review will be done in an other pull request.

# How to run the pull request ?

You will need a working development branch with the `human resources` mart enabled and seeds populated as per the `core.develop` branch requirements.
For the **cssvt**, a companion branch (*feature/retirement*) has been created to run and review the pull request.

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe
git checkout feature/retirement
git pull
cd ../cssvt.data.tbe
git checkout feature/retirement
git pull

dbt build --select +tag:retirement
```

* refactor: renaming TBE to store, uniformizing code accross dashboards and enforcing conventions

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
* The previous name of the dbt project : `tbe` (_tableau de bord equilibre_) wasn&#39;t making sense. This PR renames the project to `store`.
* The PR cleans the existing code base and improves code consistency across dashboards.
* All dashboards have now their own schema, every single one being prefixed with `dashboard_`
* The `.pbit` files have been plugged into the new schemas
* The deprecated `is_context_core`, an unused varaible has been removed. As a consequence, the `adapt` macro has been removed and every call to this macro has been replaced with the dbt-ic command `{{ source }}`

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* The PR does not introduces any changes to the code semantic.

# How to run the pull request ?
__It is advised to rename the folder `core.data.tbe` to `core.data.store` and to update the `&lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe/packages.yml` to references `core.data.store`__

__a companion branch (named `uniformization`) has been created in `cssvdc.data.tbe`  to help you review the pull request__

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe # OR core.data.store

* refactor: moving the prospective dashboards s facts to the prospective dashboard folder

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
* The PR cleans up the educ_serv mart and move back the prospective related files into the prospective dashboard folders.
* As the `fact_freq_fga` and `fact_freq_fga` are only used by the prospective dashboard, it does not make sense to have those tables in the mart. In addition, and since the introduction of the new mechanism population, base population should be directly computed from the `pop*` table.

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* The PR does not refactor the prospective dashboard to use the new population tables. This change should be a part of a more profound refactor of the dashboard.

# How to run the pull request ?
&gt; Running the pull request assumes you have the `prospective_tbe` dashboard enabled and configured as per the documentation.

**You must replace `&lt;cssXX&gt;` with the name of a (your ?) running CSS repo with the prospective dashboard enabled.

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe
