* feat: adding the retirement dashboard. This dashboard monitors the number of retired employees in the past 10 years and provides forecasts for up to 5 years.

# Objectives of the pull request
* This PR adds a new dashboard monitoring the retirement situation.
* A `fact_retirement` and a `fact_active` tables, used as a backbone for the report are introduced in the `human_resources` mart.

* A new seed, `int_sequence_0_to_1000` is introduced. This seed can be cause to generate integer sequences.

# What is left out of the pull request
* Due to the summer break, the human resources&#39; product owner (@&lt;melanie.ranger&gt; ) hasn&#39;t review the dashboard yet. The wording of the dashboard, as well as some cosmetics adjustments following Mélanie&#39;s review will be done in an other pull request.

* refactor: renaming TBE to store, uniformizing code accross dashboards and enforcing conventions

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
* The previous name of the dbt project : `tbe` (_tableau de bord equilibre_) wasn&#39;t making sense. This PR renames the project to `store`.
* The PR cleans the existing code base and improves code consistency across dashboards.
* All dashboards have now their own schema, every single one being prefixed with `dashboard_`
* The `.pbit` files have been plugged into the new schemas
* The deprecated `is_context_core`, an unused varaible has been removed. As a consequence, the `adapt` macro has been removed and every call to this macro has been replaced with the dbt-ic command `{{ source }}`

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* The PR does not introduces any changes to the code semantic.

# How to run the pull request ?
__It is advised to rename the folder `core.data.tbe` to `core.data.store` and to update the `&lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe/packages.yml` to references `core.data.store`__

__a companion branch (named `uniformization`) has been created in `cssvdc.data.tbe`  to help you review the pull request__

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe # OR core.data.store
git checkout feature/uniformization

* refactor: moving the prospective dashboards s facts to the prospective dashboard folder

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
* The PR cleans up the educ_serv mart and move back the prospective related files into the prospective dashboard folders.
* As the `fact_freq_fga` and `fact_freq_fga` are only used by the prospective dashboard, it does not make sense to have those tables in the mart. In addition, and since the introduction of the new mechanism population, base population should be directly computed from the `pop*` table.

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* The PR does not refactor the prospective dashboard to use the new population tables. This change should be a part of a more profound refactor of the dashboard.

# How to run the pull request ?
&gt; Running the pull request assumes you have the `prospective_tbe` dashboard enabled and configured as per the documentation.

**You must replace `&lt;cssXX&gt;` with the name of a (your ?) running CSS repo with the prospective dashboard enabled.

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe
git checkout feature/movingToDashboard
git pull

* Merged PR 379: refactoring the tree by gathering the dashboards into a dashboard folder and getting rid of the shared folder

# Objectives of the pull request
* This PR refactors the folder tree. The addition of the marts created a confusion between the `marts` and the `shared` folders. The common code had been moved into the `marts` leaving only the interfaces in the `shared` folder.
* A new top level folder : `dashboards` is created, gathering all the dashboards. This helps uncluttering the models between `marts` models and the dashboards-specifics models.
* The `shared` folder is removed, and the `interfaces` and `rls` folders are now top-level folders.
* Adding the dashboards top-level folder is now consistent with the use of the same convention in the `seeds` folder.

As a side effect, the `adapters / sources` files are moved into the dashboard folder they refer to.

What is left out of the PR
The PR does not update the documentation for prospectif_tbe. The deployment procedure is very specific and need to be refactored by itself.

* Merged PR 377: Simplifying the dashboards integrations by removing the need for seeds.yml files

# Objectives of the pull request
* The PR simplifies the way a dashboard can be deployed by :
  * Updating and uniformizing the documentation for all the dashboards but `prospectif_cdep`
  * Removing the need for integrators to writes `yaml` specifications when creating a seed required by a dashboard.

__Documentation__
The documentation has been reviewed for all existing dashboards. The new table-like-description has been added to all of the store&#39;s dashboard. The `data / dashboard` dependencies section has been removed. A new `additional configuration` section has been added to all dashboards previously using it.

__Seeds__
The `seeds` specification has been moved from `core.data.tbe/dbt_project` to the various and matching `core.data.tbe/seeds/*/**/schema.yml` files. These `schema.yml` files now contain : the seeds&#39; tags, the seeds&#39; schema and the seeds&#39; tests. Consequently, when implementing a seed from the `cssXX` side, it&#39;s not required to create the corresponding `schema.yml` file. Everything is now properly inherited from the core&#39;s definition. Manually repeating the tags and schema was prone to integrator&#39;s errors.

__Integrator&#39;s perspective__
By default, the `seeds` section of the `cssXX.data.tbe/dbt_project.yml` can be safely removed as it&#39;s not needed anymore to enable a seed. Of course, this section can still be used to OVERRIDE the core implementation of a (default) seed. A concrete walkthrough / use case can be found in the `res_epreuves` section of the README.

* Merged PR 370: adding table of contents to the readme

# Objectives of the pull request
* The PR aims at easing the navigation through the README. As pointed by @&lt;philippe.paquette&gt; the readme contains a lot of information and It might be tough to jump between relevant sections.
* The PR introduces a new Table of Contents, at the top of the readme  :
    * The Table of Contents can be used to jump to the `Dashboards Table` section
* The PR refactor the `Dashboards Table` by adding, for each dashboard, a link to it&#39;s integration guidelines section.

An integrator can now reach a Dashboard&#39;s documentation in two clicks.

# What is left out of the PR
* The PR does not introduce any change to the README&#39;s semantic. The already-out-of-date information is still...well, out of date.

# How to run the pull request ?
&gt; Assuming you are in a folder containing the `core.data.tbe`.

# Objectives of the pull request
* The PR aims at providing a more comprehensive introduction to the ways the store works.
* The PR adds a section with helpful links
* The PR refactors the README in two sections : one for the `integrators` who are deploying dashboard, and one for the `developers` add new dashboard to the repo.

# What is left out of the PR
* The PR only focus on the `integrator` side, as integrator are less used to the store than developers. The developers section will be refactored in an upcoming pull request
* The `prospective_cdep` is left untouched. With the addition of `Marts`, the dashboard&#39;s code should be refactored. It was useless to create a short-lived, and already out of sync documentation. Refactoring the dashboard to use the new `Marts` has been backloged

* Merged PR 356: refactor: factoring seed into a mart

# Objectives of the pull request
&gt; The PR uses a companion branch from `cssvdc.data.tbe`. That branch can be safely manipulated by the reviewers.

* The PR aims at moving a seed used in both `emp_actif` and `emp_conge` into a common folder.  As the main job of the store is to factor code, we shouldn&#39;t have to duplicate code. Common code (either `seeds` definitions or fact/dim tables should be stored in a `mart`)
* Since common code is shared, we can&#39;t attach it to only one dashboard. The usual naming convention where seeds are written under the dashboard&#39;s name they belong to does not hold anymore.
* A new convention is used (and documented). Common code schould now be stored under the `marts` folder, UNDER the mart&#39;s name the code belongs to.
* About the marts :
    * Marts are orthogonal to dashboards.
    * Marts are available for both `seeds` and `models`

The `human_resources` is introduced for both the seeds and models. The model mart is currently left empty to keep it consistent with the seed folder.
The `human_resources` mart is populated with a `seed` file definition.
The `emp_actif` dashboard has been refactored to use this new seed.

`core/seeds/marts` should only contains seeds file definition. Actual implementation of the seeds should be done on the cssXX repo. The concrete should be saved under the same folder (but in the cssXX repo) as the definition file.

**Caveat**
* `+schema` and `+tags`  does not work for seeds when set through `dbt_project` (I have raised the issue on the official DBT repo). The whole configuration of the seed, including the tags and schema, is gathered in the `yaml` defining the seed.
* `seeds` are not sensitive to setting `+enabled:true/false` meaning that every non-enabled seed will trigger a warning. (I have raised an issue on the official DBT repo). A `seed` is implicitly enabled by creating a `.CSV` file. As a consequence, every seed defined in a `mart` for which there is no `.CSV` in either the core or the cssXX repo will trigger.

* Merged PR 316: Adding 10 new materials codes

After the validation of the exams/materials codes with CSSHC, were found several ministerial codes of the materials used  by CSSHC. Since these codes are from the ministry, I added them to the default list

* Merged PR 309: feat: adding suivi_resultats_s1_s3 dashboard

# Objective
This PR aims at adding a generical `suivi_resultat` dashboard to the store.  The work is heavily inspired by the dashboard in `comite_donnees`. One major difference is that this PR eliminates the `main_course` concept.

The code is based on the GPI database and makes heavy use of the `edo` schema. Two configuration seeds are available: one to configure the courses to be tracked, and one to configure the levels the students are enrolled in we want to track. Both of these seeds can of course be overridden if needed.

Three features are voluntarily left out of the PR:
* This PR DOES NOT implement the RLS for this dashboard, as a generical solution to this issue is going to be worked on by the ops team in the upcoming sprint. A TODO has been added to the README and will be backlogged on this PR acceptance.
* This PR DOES NOT filter on the regular student, as I am going to introduce a generic, shared across dashboard, way to handle populations in an upcoming spring. Once again, a TODO has been added to the README and will be backlogged on this PR acceptance.
* The concept of `re-taking` a course has been left of the PR, as I haven&#39;t found a proper solution to it for now.

# How to run it

## Get the code
&gt; This PR has a companion branch / PR on CSSVDC. You need to checkout the CSSVDC&#39;s to run the PR without additional configuration. !310

```bash
cd core.data.tbe
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/suivi_resultat_s1_s3
cd ../cssvdc.data.tbe
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/suivi_resultat_s1_s3
```

## Optionally : drop all the schemas in your schema / database to start from a clean slate
&gt; Do not run this command when using the service account as it will drop all the development schemas.

```bash
dbt run-operation drop_schema
```

## Load the seeds, run the code and test the table
&gt; Use the `suivi_resultat` tag to limit the ETL to the suivi_resultats nodes.

```bash
dbt build --select suivi_resultat
``` ([`bce8648`](https://github.com/Sciance-Inc/core.dashboards_store/commit/bce8648a3a7e59be5658047ec43296ce1cda66dd))

* Merged PR 272: Correctifs afin d&#39;harmoniser le process

Ci-dessous un récapitulatif des modifications apportées au répertoire `core`

- `emp_conge` :
1. Pour ne plus voir le message de warning j&#39;ai modifié le schéma du projet.

![image.png](https://dev.azure.com/Centre-Expertise-IA/c2f84ed8-4636-4689-a070-433ecb89a643/_apis/git/repositories/c515b32e-0393-45f8-a0f3-3c2ce78033d2/pullRequests/272/attachments/image.png)

2. J&#39;ai également configuré un alias pour que la table générée dans la base de données soit nommée `fact_emp_conge` plutot que `empcong_fact_emp_conge`

![image (2).png](https://dev.azure.com/Centre-Expertise-IA/c2f84ed8-4636-4689-a070-433ecb89a643/_apis/git/repositories/c515b32e-0393-45f8-a0f3-3c2ce78033d2/pullRequests/272/attachments/image%20%282%29.png)

@&lt;Mohamed Sadqi&gt; , @&lt;Gabriel Thiffault&gt;  Assurez-vous que ces modifications n&#39;aient pas d&#39;impact sur le tableau de bord  (le chemin pour accéder à la table plus précisément).

- `prospectif_cdp` : petite coquille dans le schéma du projet qui générait un warning.

![image (3).png](https://dev.azure.com/Centre-Expertise-IA/c2f84ed8-4636-4689-a070-433ecb89a643/_apis/git/repositories/c515b32e-0393-45f8-a0f3-3c2ce78033d2/pullRequests/272/attachments/image%20%283%29.png)

- `shared/interfaces/geobus` et `shared/interfaces/piastre` : j&#39;ai fait des modifications afin de respecter les conventions du projet. @&lt;Maryna Zhuravlova&gt;  le nom des champs doit être en minuscule.

     ex:
![image (4).png](https://dev.azure.com/Centre-Expertise-IA/c2f84ed8-4636-4689-a070-433ecb89a643/_apis/git/repositories/c515b32e-0393-45f8-a0f3-3c2ce78033d2/pullRequests/272/attachments/image%20%284%29.png)

- `transport` :

1. J&#39;ai modifié le nom du script `stg_parc_activ_10y` par `trnsprt_parc_activ_10y`. Tout d&#39;abord, ce n&#39;est pas une table de staging donc ca ne nécessite pas de préfixe `stg`. Finalement, afin d&#39;avoir un schéma centralisé, j&#39;ai rajouté le prefixe `trnsprt_`

2. J&#39;ai également configuré un alias pour que la table généré dans la base de données soit nommé `parc_activ_10y` plutôt que `trnsprt_parc_activ_10y`

![image (5).png](https://dev.azure.com/Centre-Expertise-IA/c2f84ed8-4636-4689-a070-433ecb89a643/_apis/git/repositories/c515b32e-0393-45f8-a0f3-3c2ce78033d2/pullRequests/272/attachments/image%20%285%29.png)

3. En conséquence, j&#39;ai ajusté le schéma qui d&#39;ailleurs ne fonctionnait pas initialement.

@&lt;Maryna Zhuravlova&gt; , assure-toi que ces modifications n&#39;aient pas d&#39;impact sur le tableau de bord. Je pense que le tableau de bord ne retrouvera pas sa table source sachant que son nom a été modifié

- `dbt_project` : j&#39;ai corrigé la section `transport` du fichier pour harmoniser le processus.

* Merged PR 260: Adding data for res_etapes dashboard

# Objective
* The PR aims at adding the metrics table for a new dashboard : res_etapes dashboard.
* The dashboard will display metrics (aggregated either at a school or a CSS level) regarding the success rate to a set of predefined evaluations.
* A set of predefined evaluations, common across al CSS is defined through a seed.
* The PR allows the customization of the evaluations list, by the definition of another seed in the CSS&#39;s specific package. The procedure is described in the README.

# Tables
* `rstps_dim_subject_evaluation` implements the mechanism to look for and add a table of CSS&#39;s specific evaluations to the default ones.
* `rstps_fact_evaluations_grades` and `rstps_fact_evaluations_grades_from_dim` contains a few hooks to later add the data from biodistribution as well as the populations and some CSS&#39;s specific data.

# Commits
- feat: adding GPI&#39;s edo schema interfaces
- feat: adding a subject_evaluation dimensions table unioning a default and a custom CSV
- feat: adding metrics tables
- docs: adding documentation about the dashboard activation
- docs: adding a placeholder for the upcomming dashboard

# How to run and check the PR ?
1. Enable the dashboard in you CSS&#39;s specific dashboard :

```yaml
# cssXX/dbt_project.yml
models:
    tbe:
        res_etapes:
            +enabled: True
```
2. Load the seeds into the database. By default, only the default seed will be loaded. Refer to the README to add your CSS&#39;s specific seed file.

```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```

3. Run the dashboard
* As all related resources are tagged with `res_etapes`, you can limit the ETL execution to this dashboard resources by adding a select statement.

```bash
dbt run --select &#39;res_etapes&#39;
```

* Merged PR 252: solving the between-schemas-tables-names-conflicting

# Commits
- refactor: adding missing schema to increase between tables segregations
- doc: adding documentation about the between-schema-tables-names-conflict
- fix: the schema is now written in full letters

# Objective
## Primary
* The PR aims a documenting a way to solve the `between-schemas-tables-names-conflicting` issue.
* This issue occurs when two tables, in two different projects, share the same name as illustrated by the `fact_absence` in the following files tree

```
.
└── core.store/
    ├── reporting/
    │   └── employees_absences.pbit
    └── models/
        ├── employees_absences/
        │   └── fact_absences.sql
        └── dummy/
            └── fact_absences.sql
```

## Secondary
* The PR updates the `dbt project` to namespacing the dashboards through the use of schemas.
* The PR also adds a bunch of minor typos corrections (ongoing work) in the readme
* The PR adds a new table in the `README` to identify the owner of the various dashboards.
* The PR writes down some new conventions to be reviewed

# Solution
* The PR updates the `README` with the addition of a new section gathering common DBT issues we might encounter and the corresponding patterns to solve these issues.

# How to run it
* The PR *does not* introduce new code.

# Side effects
* The PR has no side effect that need to be reflected in the css-specific packages ([`8c07c89`](https://github.com/Sciance-Inc/core.dashboards_store/commit/8c07c8959d97d3311cddb5b8e5f25433d06454ee))
