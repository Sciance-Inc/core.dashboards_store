### Fix

* fix: disembiguate duplicates resulting from multiple fetchs from the Jade database

Done with Fred and Mohamed :

* Remove duplicates introduced by fetching the Jade database multples times.
* Only the most recent upserted grade is now used., Previous results are removed. ([`b66b53e`](https://github.com/Sciance-Inc/core.dashboards_store/commit/b66b53ec6f377ee072240be60bc1dd46f4f6a098))

### Refactor

* refactor(hr mart): switching to historical activity table

This PR refactors the RH mart and introduces new tables than can be used to ease future downstream computations.

* This PR firsts adds a new **historical** `stg_activity_history` tables. This table is a consolidated version of `pai_hemp`
* The main job history of employees, which was previously unavailable, is built by parsing the XML payload of `hcha_pai_dos_empl`.
* A **historical**, table with point-in-time metadata is derived from precedings table. This `fact_activity_yearly` provide the point-in-time following attributes :
    * workplace
    * stat_eng
    * stat_empl
    * main_job (main ref empl)
    * This table can then be used a a spine to add point-in-time filters to every metrics computed at an employee / year level.
* A `fact_current_active_employees` table is derived from the `fact_activity_table`, listing all the currently enroled employees is introduced.

The retirement dashboard is rebuilt upon the new tables.

To reduce the need for double joining on both `pai_dos` and `pai_dos2`, a new `dim_employees` is created, providing usefull static information at the employees level. Future static metrics of interest could be added to this table.

As noted by Maryna, the meaning of the seeds is not constant over time. To allow for time-varying seed, the two existing seeds are refactored with the addition of two new columns : `valid_from` and `valid_until`.

Yearly versions of the seed tables are derived in `dim_employment_status_yearly` and `dim_engagement_status_yearly`. The two derived tables expand the seeds by year. Time varying mapping can then by handled by joining on both the code (ex stat_eng) and the year we want the valid code for.

Permanence will be rebuilt upon the new activity table. For now, the table is flagged as deprecated and a new `stg_seniority` is added as work-in-progress.

* `stg_seniority` will be completed in another PR, this one being big enough.
* Refactoring other RH dashboards schould be done in another PR

**A companion branch cssvt.data.tbe/feature/rh_dim_empl has been created to help the reviewers. The companion branch targets CSSVT**

### Chore

* chore: adding the sqlfmt linter

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
&gt; Describe the high level purpose of your pull request. What are you trying to achieve ? How are you doing it ?

* The PR introduces the `sqlfmt` formatter in the tools chain.
* `sqlfmt` parses the SQL code and produces a formatted version of it.
* The formatted version uses standard style guidelines, that are NOT developer-dependant, resulting in a more coherent developing experience.
* Formatting the SQL code will help developers review other developer&#39;s code

* The PR also adds a `git pre-commit-hook` that can be installed to automagically format the code prior to the commit.
* The pre-commit-hook can be install with the commands documented in the `README.md`

* A new item is added to the `pull-request-template` to remind developers of formatting their code.

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
&gt; Describe what is not included in the pull request. Why did you not include it in the PR. What are the next steps ?

* The PR does not decide on whether or not, the particular style-guide of `sqlfmt` should be accepted as-is or tuned. For now, everything is set as default

# How to review the PR ?
* The commit `style: applying fmt` contains ALL newly-styled files.
* I advise you not to first select this commit, as doing so will impair your ability to review the other files.

# How to run the pull request ?
&gt; Provide the code required to run the pull request. This is the code that will be used to review your pull request. **The provided code must work as-is. If a DBT error is raised while running the code, the PR will be rejected. The following code / placeholder is only provided as documentation / helper to get you started and you will need to adjust it.**

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.store and the cssvdc.data.store folder.

* The PR create a new table in the `mart` : `fact_absences_sequence` listing all the absences sequences for the students.
* The dashboard uses the new population mechanism.

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* As there was not prototyping phase for this dashboard, some cosmetic / filtering adjustments will have to be made once this dashboard is presented to the clients.

# How to run the pull request ?
You will need a repo with the population tables ... populated. A companion branch has been created on the CSSVDC repo to help you review this PR. The companion branch&#39;s name is `feature/absenteism`. (yes, with  a typo -_-)

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder, where &lt;cssXX&gt; being either CSSVDC or your own repo with a `feature/absenteism` population-enabled branch.

cd core.data.tbe
git checkout feature/absenteeism
git pull
cd ../&lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe
git checkout feature/absenteism
git pull

* feat: adding the retirement dashboard. This dashboard monitors the number of retired employees in the past 10 years and provides forecasts for up to 5 years.

# Objectives of the pull request
* This PR adds a new dashboard monitoring the retirement situation.
* A `fact_retirement` and a `fact_active` tables, used as a backbone for the report are introduced in the `human_resources` mart.
* A `fact_retirement_forecasts` is added to the mart as it could be reused in a more strategical dashboard.
* A new seed, `int_sequence_0_to_1000` is introduced. This seed can be cause to generate integer sequences.

# What is left out of the pull request
* Due to the summer break, the human resources&#39; product owner (@&lt;melanie.ranger&gt; ) hasn&#39;t review the dashboard yet. The wording of the dashboard, as well as some cosmetics adjustments following Mélanie&#39;s review will be done in an other pull request.

# How to run the pull request ?

You will need a working development branch with the `human resources` mart enabled and seeds populated as per the `core.develop` branch requirements.
For the **cssvt**, a companion branch (*feature/retirement*) has been created to run and review the pull request.

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe

* refactor: renaming TBE to store, uniformizing code accross dashboards and enforcing conventions

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
* The previous name of the dbt project : `tbe` (_tableau de bord equilibre_) wasn&#39;t making sense. This PR renames the project to `store`.
* The PR cleans the existing code base and improves code consistency across dashboards.
* All dashboards have now their own schema, every single one being prefixed with `dashboard_`
* The `.pbit` files have been plugged into the new schemas
* The deprecated `is_context_core`, an unused varaible has been removed. As a consequence, the `adapt` macro has been removed and every call to this macro has been replaced with the dbt-ic command `{{ source }}`

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* The PR does not introduces any changes to the code semantic.

# How to run the pull request ?
__It is advised to rename the folder `core.data.tbe` to `core.data.store` and to update the `&lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe/packages.yml` to references `core.data.store`__

__a companion branch (named `uniformization`) has been created in `cssvdc.data.tbe`  to help you review the pull request__

* refactor: moving the prospective dashboards s facts to the prospective dashboard folder

# Objectives of the Pull Request ?
* The PR cleans up the educ_serv mart and move back the prospective related files into the prospective dashboard folders.
* As the `fact_freq_fga` and `fact_freq_fga` are only used by the prospective dashboard, it does not make sense to have those tables in the mart. In addition, and since the introduction of the new mechanism population, base population should be directly computed from the `pop*` table.

# What is left out of the Pull Request ?
* The PR does not refactor the prospective dashboard to use the new population tables. This change should be a part of a more profound refactor of the dashboard.

# How to run the pull request ?
&gt; Running the pull request assumes you have the `prospective_tbe` dashboard enabled and configured as per the documentation.

**You must replace `&lt;cssXX&gt;` with the name of a (your ?) running CSS repo with the prospective dashboard enabled.

```bash
# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the &lt;cssXX&gt;.data.tbe folder.
