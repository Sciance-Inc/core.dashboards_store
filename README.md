  <p> The Dashboards store is a collection of PowerBi dashboards and SQL scripts that can be used to quickly leverage a schoolboard's data warehouse. It is designed to be used by schoolboard's data analysts to quickly build and deploy dashboards. It's free. </p>

## Sponsor
The core.dashboard_store is sponsored and developped by [Sciance Inc](https://sciance.ca/). We provide data analytics and data science services to school boards and other educational institutions. We are passionate about helping students and educators by providing them with the tools and insights they need to succeed. We believe that by sharing our work, we can help others and make the world a better place, or, at least, a world without pie charts (a small win, but a win nonetheless).

## Our services
We offer a wide range of services to help school boards and educational institutions make the most of their data. We can help you deploy the dashboards store, build custom dashboards, and develop predictive models to help you better understand your data. We also offer training and support to help you get the most out of your data. If you are interested in learning more about our services, please contact us ! 

We also recently added an Orchestrator to help you deploy, manage and use the dashboards store. [Check it out !](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sciance-Inc/core.dashboards_store/develop/tooling/orchestration/sos.pdf)
