# Assuming you are in a folder containing both the core.data.tbe and the <cssXX>.data.tbe folder.
# Update the code
cd core.data.tbe
git checkout feature/<feature_name>
git pull
# Might be required if you update either the poetry file or the lock file
# poetry shell && poetry lock && poetry install 
cd ../<cssXX>.data.tbe
git checkout feature/<feature_name>
git pull
