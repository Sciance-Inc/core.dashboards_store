## Conventions and developement guidelines

### Committing

#### sqlfmt

> We use `sqlfmt` as an SQL formatter. Wheither we love it or not, we have to use it, so everybody code will look the same, making collaboration easier. Some linting rules might be controversial, but at least they are consistent and explicit.

Before committing, make sure to run the following command

```bash
sqlfmt .
```

... You might wan't to rerun a `dbt build` after formatting everything. `sqlfmt` schould'nt break anything, but we are better safe than sorry.

#### Commit message

> Commit messages use the Commitizen convention.

Please, make sure all of your commit messages start with a type. The following types are available :

- `feat` : A new feature
- `fix` : A bug fix
- `docs` : Documentation only changes
- `style` : Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor` : A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` : A code change that improves performance
- `test` : Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore` : Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- `revert` : Reverts a previous commit

### Folders structure and convention

- All the SQL / Python code live in the `models` folder.
- All dashboards and reports live in the `reporting` folder.

**About the `models` folder**

The `models` folder is organized as follow :

```
.
└── models/
    ├── interfaces/
    │   └── database_spame/
    │       └── mart_foobar
    ├── marts/
    │   └── mart_foobar
    └── dashboards/
        ├── spam/
        │   ├── features/
        │   │   └── fact_absences.sql
        │   └── pbi_tables/
        │      └── fact_absences.sql
        └── egg/
            ...
```

Where :

- `dashboards` Each subfolder of `models/dashboards` should be named after the corresponding dashboard it's belongs to (**one dashboard, one folder containing it's SQL code**).
- `interfaces` contains mapping to the interfaces tables. Each interface table can be overrided to add custom connection logic to the undelrying database..
- `marts` contains the ... marts. A `mart` is a collection of tables reused/shared accross between dashboards.

### Integration test and the nightly build

> The nightly build is an automated check on the repo happening at the end (the night ^^) of each day

When introducting a new **NON-OPTIONAL** seed in the `core.data.store` repo, you must add it into `core.data.store/nightly/dbt/seeds` folder, so the next Nightly build won't fail because of a missing seed. The seed must be populated with data from CSSVDC, as the CSSVDC is used as a target database for the integration tests.
You can also run the integration suit locally. Please, refer to the `core.data.store/nightly/README.md` file for more details.

### Marts

#### `educ_serv`

> This mart gather all the data related to the education service.

##### Populations

`Populations` are sets of students used as a filter by various dashboards. **you can refer to analyses/marts/educ_serv/staging/population folder and use the population template to build/define your populations**.

The following populations are mandatory (cf `adatpers`) and schould be defined :

- `stg_ele_prescolaire`
- `stg_ele_primaire_reg`
- `stg_ele_primaire_adapt`
- `stg_ele_secondaire_reg`
- `stg_ele_secondaire_adapt`

The integrator can add new populations by overrding the `custom_fgj_populations.sql` model. To do so :

1. Create a new file in `cssXX.data.store/models/marts/educ_serv/staging/populations` named `custom_fgj_populations.sql`
2. Your `custom_fgj_populations` model schould be implemeted as a union of your own custom populations.
3. Disable the core's placeholder in the `cssXX.data.store`:

```yaml
# cssXX.data.store/dbt_project.yml

models:
  core_dashboards_store:
    marts:
      educ_serv:
        staging:
          populations:
            custom_fgj_populations:
              +enabled: false
```

**Developers : when creating a new dashboard using the population mechanism, you must register it's tag in the `marts/educ_serv/adapters.yml` file, for it trigger the population computation.**

### human resources

> This mart gather all the data related to the human resources departement

##### Populating the marts seed

> This dashboard requiers the specification of the seeds in the `human_resources` mart.

The seed must be populated in `cssXX.data.store/seeds/marts/human_resources/` and as per the definition of the `core.data.store/seeds/marts/human_resources/schema.yml` mart.

Please refer to the `core.data.store/seeds/marts/human_resources/schema.yml` mart documentation to get the concrete implementation.

Do not forget to refresh your seeds with the `dbt seeds --select tag:human_resources --full-refresh` command.

### Exposing the freshness of the data into the dashboard

> The `core` provide a mechanism to expose the freshness of the data into the dashboard. This mechanism is call `the stamper` and can be enabled and used through macros.

#### Enabling the `stamper`

> Must be done ONCE in your `cssXX.data.store/dbt_project.yaml`.

The stamper is a table collecting metadata about your ETL's run. To enable the data collection, you first enable it in your `dbt_project.yml` by adding the two following hooks :

```yaml
# cssXX.data.store/dbt_project.yml
# Hooks
on-run-start:
  - "{{ core_dashboards_store.init_metadata_table() }}"
on-run-end:
  - "{{ core_dashboards_store.purge_metadata_table() }}"
```

#### `stamping` my new dashboard

> A good practice is to only stamp the reporting tables.

**Only successfull run will be stamped. Meaning that taking the `MIN(run_ended_at)` will give you the last time your ETL run has been sucessfull. This is the worstcase scenario freshness**

To add a stamp to your dashboard you can either :

- Add the following `post_hook` into your model :

```sql
# model.sql
{{ config(
    post_hook='{{ core_dashboards_store.stamp_model("my_dashboard") }}',
) }}
```

- Stamp multiples models at once by adding the hook directrly into the `core/dbt_project`

```yaml
models:
  core_dashboards_store:
    dashboards:
      my_dashboard:
        +tags: ["my_dashboard"]
        +schema: dashboard_my_dashboard
        pbi_tables:
          +post_hook: ["{{ core_dashboards_store.stamp_model('my_dashboard') }}"]
```

**The second option is to be prefered if all of your report models are under a common folder**

#### Using the `stamper` in your dashboard

In PowerBi, you can easily fetch the last run of your ETL by filtering on the argument provided to the `stamp_model` macro.

#### Variable conventions

- Don't use spaces in your variables names
- Please, stick to a _snake_case_ naming convention
  - Use the interface tables to set the right names for the variables.
- Reserved keywords schould be written in caps.

#### dbt_project.yaml conventions

> The `dbt_project.yaml` has to be updated every time a new dashboard is added to the core_dashboards_store.

- Each dashboard (ie, each subfolder of the `models` folder) schould be given a _tag_ and a _schema_. The following exemple shows the minimal lines to add to the `dbt_project.yaml` file to add `dummy_dashboard` to the core_dashboards_store. The rational behind this convention is to ease filtering information in either the database or the documentation.

```yaml
models: # Already here, for reference only
  core_dashboards_store: # Already here, for reference only
    +enabled: False # Already here, for reference only
    dummy:
      +tags: ["dummy"]
      +schema: "dummy"
```

### Naming conventions

- use _snake_case_ to names your variables.

#### Table conventions

- Use _snake_case_ naming conventions.
- Use a **prefix** to indicates the high-level objective of the table. The following table prefixing conventions schould be used.

| Table type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Prefix   | Exemple              |

# How to

## Between projects conflicting tables names

> Some tables names are quite generic (spine, dim_school) and can be used in various contexts without refering to the same underlying table. To avoid confusion, please, use the following pattern to disambiguate the tables.

##### Exemple

Let's consider the following two dashboards : `employees_absences` and `dummy`.

```
.
└── core.store/
    ├── reporting/
    │   └── employees_absences.pbit
    └── models/
        ├── employees_absences/
        │   └── fact_absences.sql
        └── dummy/
            └── fact_absences.sql
```

```yaml
models:
  +employees_absences:
    +schema: "employees_absences"
    +tags: ["employees_absences"]
  +dummy:
    +schema: "dummy"
    +tags: ["dummy"]
```

The two dashboards are using a table named `fact_absences` but the SQL code is not the same, so I do need thoose two tables. Unfortunetely, DBT will raise an error as each name has to be unique.

An easy fix is to rename one of the `fact_absences` tables. Let's say we rename `modesl/dummy/fact_absences` to `dummy_fact_absences`. DBT will now be able to compile the code and any downstream task of the dummy project could refers to the table using `{{ ref('dummy_fact_absence') }}`

This issue with this fix is that DBT will output a `dummy_fact_absences` table in the `dummy` schema. This is redundant, as the conflict happens _between_ schemas, and not _within_ the `dummy` schema. Fortunately, we can override the outputed name in the SQL code by adding the following line into `dummy_fact_absences.sql`.

```sql
{{ config(alias='fact_absences') }}
```

#### DBT error message

In such case, DBT would output an error message similar to the following one.

```
Compilation Error
  dbt found two models with the name "<foobar>".

  Since these resources have the same name, dbt will be unable to find the correct resource
  when looking for ref("foobar").

  To fix this, change the name of one of these resources:
  - model.core_dashboards_store.removeme (models/prospectif_cdp/features/foobar.sql)
  - model.core_dashboards_store.removeme (models/emp_conge/feature/foobar.sql)
```

##### Pattern

> The generic pattern to solve the between-project-conflicting-tables-names issue is the following :

1. Prefix your table with the (unique) friendly name of your dashboard.
   - The friendly name schould be short. Maybe 3-to-10 letters. `dummy` could become `dmy`
2. Add a DBT directive into your table code to output the table under it's original name by setting the alias property
