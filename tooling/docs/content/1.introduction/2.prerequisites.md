# What do I need ?

::alert{type="warning "}
Both the **users** and **developers** schould be familiar with [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/), and [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). If you are not, we recommend you to take a look at the [DBT](https://docs.getdbt.com/) documentation before going any further.

## Taming the DBT's wilderness ðŸ¦¬
I haven't finished (yet) reading the Internet, but I have curated a list of resources that I found useful to get started with DBT.

1. ðŸ¦” DBT's fundamentals 
   * [DBT's own learning material](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/fundamentals)
   * [DBT, the easy way](https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-dbt-the-easy-way-7d9f773d25ea)
2. ðŸ¦… Advanced DBT
   * [Designing a model](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-design-a-dbt-model-from-scratch-8c72c7684203)
   * [DBT's course about seeds and analyzis](https://courses.getdbt.com/courses/analyses-seeds)
   * [Reliable testing](https://www.synq.io/blog/the-complete-guide-to-building-reliable-data-with-dbt-tests)
   * [Automating the ETL](https://medium.com/@datajuls/why-i-moved-my-dbt-workloads-to-github-and-saved-over-65-000-759b37486001)

## Could be usefull if you now a little bit about thoose techs to.

* __GIT__ [because even if not everyone is building a kernel, a version-manager always comes in handy](https://git-scm.com/)
* __Ubuntu__ [Some good stuffs might come for free ;) ](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
* __yaml__ [A human-readable data-serialization language. Like JSON but worst.](https://circleci.com/blog/what-is-yaml-a-beginner-s-guide/?psafe_param=1&utm_source=google&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=sem-google-dg--uscan-en-dsa-tROAS-auth-brand&utm_term=g_-_c__dsa_&utm_content=&gclid=CjwKCAjwrpOiBhBVEiwA_473dK-ujEm1G7ONji2IsFzoHdn8liN3nCBMiTl9oL1qPxf759sXoEqdWRoCe-sQAvD_BwE)
* __SQL__ [Structured Query Language. The language used to query the database.](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/)
* __Python__ [DBT is built in Python, you might want to have a look at it.](https://docs.python.org/3.10/)
* __Poetry__ [but let's face the truth... PIP is garbage. So we ditched it for Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

# Your own personal Linux
::alert{type="warning"}
**DBT** and **Git** are easier to use with Linux rather than Windows. If you don't have access to *nix machine your can mess-up with, you schould set up your Own Personal Linux with **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.
::

## How to setup WSL ?
> It's paramount you follow the instructions for **Windows Subsytem for Linux Version 2**. The first version was buggy as hell.

* [Install WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
* [Install ubuntu on WSL2](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview)

You won't necessary needs the Ubuntu's GUI to work, but that's great knowledge anyway.

::alert{type="info"}
We advise on using **Ubuntu**, but you will be at ease with any distro, providing you know how to use it.
