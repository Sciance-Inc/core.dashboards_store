# You did great ! 🥳
You have a working `cssXX.dashboards_data` DBT project that can be used to populate the store's database. Unfortunately, you are not done yet : you still have to configure the `cssXX.dashboards_store` project, and to run the ETL.


## What's done.
::list{type="success"}
- Configuring my machine
- Cloning the repo and installing the environnement
- Configuring the database connection

# What's left 🛠️.
::list{type="warning"}
- **Linking the interfaces** to the source databases
- **Populating the seeds**. Seeds are required to populate the seeds.
- **Enabling dashboards**. That's the whole point, isnt'it ?

::alert{type="info"}
Refers to the "User guide -> Configuration" section to learn how to configure the store.
