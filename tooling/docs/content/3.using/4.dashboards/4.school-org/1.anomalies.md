# Deployment
:badge[tag:anomalies]{type="success"}
:badge[new in v0.18.0]

## Database

Both the `gpi` and `jade` database must be linked to the project. Please refer to the [linking a database](/using/configuration/databases) section for more information about how to link a database.

## Adapters

An adapter must be implemented for the dashboard to work. Please refer to the [linking an adapter](/using/configuration/adapts-seeds) 

## Dbt project specification
> Update your `cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml` file with the following snippet.

1. Enabling models and dashboards from the core repo

```yaml
# cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
models:
  core_dashboards_store: # Enable the models from the core repo
    dashboards:
      org_scolaire:
        anomalies:
          +enabled: True
    interfaces: 
      gpi:
        +enabled: True
      jade:
        +enabled: True

```

2. Enabling the adapter

An adapter named `anml_stg_population` must exists with the two following columns (fiche, id_eco). This adapter is used to select the rows we want to track the anomalies for.
