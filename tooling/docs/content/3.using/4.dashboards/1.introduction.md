## What is a dashboard ?
Within the context of the store, a `dashboard` is a `.pbit` file. Every dashboards is stored in the `core.dashboards_store/reporting` folder (lookup the dashboard you wan't to deploy by it's name).

To deploy a dashboard, you will need to :
1. Enabling it, as well as all it's dependencies (marts, interfaces, etc.). Please refer to the [enabling a dashboard](/using/configuration/enabling) section for more information.
2. Optionaly : configure it, by overriding some of the models it's based upon or by adding custom seeds.
3. Deploy the `PowerBi` file to your PowerBi service, and update the `pbit` connection so it points to your `<store_dev|store_prod>` database.
