# Deployment
:badge[tag:res_epreuves]{type="success"}
:badge[new in v0.7.0]

## Databases

The `gpi` database must be linked to the project. Please refer to the [linking a database](/using/configuration/linking) section for more information about how to link a database.

## Dbt project specification
> Update your `cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml` file with the following snippet.

1. Enabling the models
```yaml
# cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
models:
  store: # Enable the models from the core repo
    marts:
        educ_serv:
            +enabled: True        
    res_epreuves:
      +enabled: True
    shared:
        interfaces: # The dashboard only needs the GPI database
            gpi:
                +enabled: True
```  
2. Setting a custom `cod_css`
::alert{type=warning}
cod_css will be used to filter Jade table by the organisation code to exclude student belonging to other CSS. This variable **MUST** be set for the dashboard to work.
::

```yaml
#cssXX.data.dbe/dbt_project.yml
vars:
    # res_epreuves's dashboard variables:
    res_epreuves:
        cod_css: ###% --the first 3 digits of your organization code
```

# configuration
::alert{type=warning}
The configuration is optional. If you don't provide a configuration, the dashboard will use the default configuration.
::

## Customizing the tracked courses
> This table needs some seeds. Make sure to run `dbt seed --full-refresh` to populate the seeds.

* To add a list of in-house courses to be tracked :
  1. Add a `.csv` file in your `cssXX.dashboards_store/seeds/res_epreuves` folder. The file must be named `custom_subject_evaluation.csv`. The file must be populated with the colums described in `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/res_epreuves/schema.yml` (refers to the `custom_subject_evaluation` seed). You might want to use the `GPI.Edo.ResultatsCompetenceEtape` table to find the appropriate mapping.

  2. Trigger a refresh of your seeds 

```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```

::alert{type=info}
Please refer to the [seeds](/using/marts/seeds) section for more information about how to use and populate seeds.
::

## Setting a custom `threshold`
> The threshold is used to compute the identify the overachieving students. It is set to 70% by default.

You can override the default threshold by adding the following variable in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yaml
# cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
vars:
    # res_epreuves's dashboard variables:
    res_epreuves:
        threshold: 70
```
