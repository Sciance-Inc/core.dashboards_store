# Deployment 
:badge[tag:chronic_absenteeism]{type="success"}
:badge[new in v0.7.0]

## Databases 

The `gpi` database must be linked to the project. Please refer to the [linking a database](/using/configuration/linking) section for more information about how to link a database.

## Marts 

The following marts must be enabled for the dashboard to work. Please refer to the [enabling a mart](/using/configuration/enabling) section for more information about how to enable a mart.
* `educ_serv`

## Dbt project specification
> Update your `cssxx.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml` file with the following snippet.

```yaml
# cssxx.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
models:
    tbe:
        marts:
            educ_serv:
                +enabled: True                  
        dashboards:                                   
            chronic_absenteeism:
                +enabled: True
        interfaces:
            gpi:
                +enabled: True
```

# configuration
::alert{type=warning}
The configuration is optional. If you don't provide a configuration, the dashboard will use the default configuration.

## Overriding the absences bracketing strategy
> By default, the dashboard will group up absences using the brackets from `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboard/schronic_absenteeism/repartition_brackets.csv`

To get a custom bracketing strategy, you can provide your own implementation of `repartition_brackets`. To do so :
1. Write a CSV file named `repartition_brackets` in the `cssXX.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/chronic_absenteeism` folder populated as per the `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/chronic_absenteism/schema.yml`'s definition.
2. Disable the default seed by using the the following snippet in your `dbt_project.yml` file : 

```yaml
#cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
seeds:
  store:
    dashboards:
      chronic_absenteeism:
        repartition_brackets:
          +enabled: False
```

__When overriding the repartition bracket, you will need to manualy update the `lorenz` measures from the Dahsboard's concentration page.__

## Filtering the absences / lateness of students
> By default, ALL abseces and lateness as treated the same way in the dashboard.

To manually exclude some lateness / absences reasons, you can override the `core.dashboards_store/models/marts/educ_serv/staging/absences/stg_dim_absences_retards_inclusion.sql`.

To override this file, just provide your own implementation of `cssXX.dashboards_store/models/marts/educ_serv/staging/absences/stg_dim_absences_retards_inclusion.sql` and disable the one from the core by adding this following snippet to your `cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml` :

```yaml
#cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
models:
  store:
    marts:
      educ_serv:
        staging:
          absences:
            stg_dim_absences_retards_inclusion:
              +enabled: False
```

As an example (you will add to tailor this script to your own needs), the following `sql` filters out the lateness reason. 

```sql
-- cssXX.dashboards_store/models/marts/educ_serv/staging/absences/stg_dim_absences_retards_inclusion.sql
select id_eco, motif_abs, max(descr) as desc
from {{ ref("i_gpm_t_motif_abs") }}
where lower(descr) not like '%retard%'
group by
    id_eco,
    motif_abs
```
