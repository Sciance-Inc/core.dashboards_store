The `GPI` and `Jade` database must be linked to the project. Please refer to the [linking a database](/using/configuration/databases) section for more information about how to link a database.

## Seed

::alert{type=warning}
A `seed` is requiered for the dashboard to work.
::

The dashboard needs the `matiere_evalue` seed to be available. Please refer to the [seeding](/using/configuration/adapts-seeds) section for more information about how to seed a mart. The seed is required in order to populate the sanctioned subjects. Since you won't need to override it, you can simply run this command to create the seed: dbt seed --select +tag:diplome
The seed is discribed in `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/diplome/schema.yml`.

## Marts

The following marts must be enabled for the dashboard to work. Please refer to the [enabling a mart](/using/configuration/enabling) section for more information about how to enable a mart.
