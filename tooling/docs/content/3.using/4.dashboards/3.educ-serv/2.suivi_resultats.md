:badge[new in v0.10.0]

## Database 

The `GPI` database must be linked to the project. Please refer to the [linking a database](/using/configuration/linking) section for more information about how to link a database.

## Dashboards

This dashboard depends on the `res_scolaires` dashboard. Make sure to deploy the `res_scolaires` dashboard before deploying the `suivi_resultats` dashboard.

## DBT project specification
> Update your `cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml` file with the following snippet and add the `cod_css` variable.


```yaml
#cssXX.dashboards_store/dbt_project.yml
models: 
  store:
    marts:
        educ_serv:
            +enabled: True

## Customizing the tracked courses
> This table needs some seeds. Make sure to run `dbt seed --full-refresh` to populate the seeds.

* To add a list of in-house courses to be tracked :
  1. Add a `.csv` file in your `cssXX.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/suivi_resultats` folder. The file must be named `custom_tracked_courses.csv`. The file must be populated with the colums described in `core.dashboards_store/seeds/dashboards/suivi_resultats/schema.yml` (refers to the `custom_tracked_courses` seed). You might want to use the `core.dashboards_store/models/marts/educ_serv/staging/stg_descr_mat` table to find the appropriate mapping.
  2. Trigger a refresh of your seeds 

```bash
dbt seed --full-refresh
```

::alert{type=info}
Please refer to the [seeds](/using/marts/seeds) section for more information about how to use and populate seeds.
