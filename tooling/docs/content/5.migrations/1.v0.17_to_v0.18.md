# ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Instructions

## üß© Dependency Updates
::alert{type="danger"}
**Breaking Changes**
::

- Updated `dbt` to **v1.9.0**
- Updated adapter to `sciance/dbt-fabric` **v1.9.4**
- Environment now managed via `poetry` **v2.0.0**
  - The `pyproject.toml` now uses Poetry 2.0 format
- **Minimum Python version is now 3.10**

You **must** upgrade your environment accordingly:

- To manage multiple Python versions, install [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
- To install `poetry` v2.0.0, run:  
  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```

::alert{type="warning"}
Poetry v2.0.0 has deprecated `poetry shell`.  
Use `poetry env activate` instead to activate your virtual environment.
Be carefull, beacuse of reasons, `poetry env activate` will not activate the environment in your current shell, it will return the command you need to run in your current shell to activate the environment.
You can use `eval $(poetry env activate)` to activate the environment in your current shell.

## üè∑Ô∏è Project Renaming
::alert{type="danger"}
**Breaking Changes**
::

- The project name has been changed from `store` ‚Üí `core_dashboards_store`
- All references to `store` **must** be replaced with `core_dashboards_store`, including:
  - Resource declarations in `dbt_project.yml` (`models`, `seeds`, `tests`, `hooks`)
  - Macro calls in any `.sql` file

Example fix in `dbt_project.yml`:

```sql
{{ store.get_current_year() }} # is deprecated and should be replaced with
{{ core_dashboards_store.get_current_year() }}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è `dbt_project.yml` Updates
::alert{type="info"}
**Non-breaking Change**
::

- New macro added: `core_dashboards_store.drop_tmp_table_for_current_model`
  - Cleans up dangling temp tables for the current model
  - Recommended for use as a pre-hook in `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
models:
  +pre-hook:
    - "{{ core_dashboards_store.drop_tmp_table_for_current_model(model_name=this.name) }}"
  core_dashboards_store:
    ...
```

This ensures temporary artifacts are properly removed before model execution, preventing a potential issue when dbt is not gracefully terminated.
