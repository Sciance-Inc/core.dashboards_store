git pull
# Might be required if you update either the poetry file or the lock file

cd ../<cssXX>.dashboards_store
git checkout feature/<feature_name>

* **Code** :
  * [ ] The code I'm asking a review for is working. **I understand that my PR will be rejected as-is otherwise.**
  * [ ] My code follows the conventions described in the `contribution guide`.
  * [ ] My `models` / `seeds` / `adapters` are tested and documented in DBT 9through the `yaml` files.

    * [ ] I have you populated the `tooling/nightly` project with my new seed / adapter.

  * I have added a new **dashboard** : 
    * [ ] I have updated the `core.dashboards_store/tooling/template/{{ cookiecutter.css_short_name + '.dashboards_store' }}/dbt_project.yml` file with my new dashboard. 
    * [ ] I have added a new `doc` page in the `core.dashboards_store/tooling/docs/content/` appropriate folder, describing what my dashboards does and how to configure it.
    * [ ] The dashboard is saved with `.pbit` extension, **not** a `.pbix` extension, so it doesn't contains any data.
